/*7. Code a style rule for the <footer> element that displays a rebeccapurple border above it.
8. Code a style rule for the <h1> element. The h1 font should be 150% of the default specified
in the body, and it’s color should be rebeccapurple.
9. Code a style rule for the <h2> element. The h2 font should be 125% of the default font.
10. Code a style rule for the <h3> element. The h3 font should be 115% of the default font.
11. Apply appropriate margins or padding to the <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <blockquote>, <ul>,
and <li> elements.
12. Code a style rule for the <cite> element that changes its color to rebeccapurple, removes the
italics from the text, and makes the text bold.
13. Float the image to the left and apply appropriate margins or padding so the text floats to its
right. Make sure the heading that comes after the image doesn’t float to the right, and that the
first paragraph after the image lines up with it at the top.
14. Code style rules for the paragraphs within the footer so the font size is 90% of the default, the
font weight is bold, the paragraphs are centered, and the spacing above and below looks
good.
15. Code a style rule that creates three custom properties for the colors used by the page. Then,
modify the color and background-color properties in the style sheet so they use the custom
property instead of the name of the color./*
